Someone out there SURELY knows something. In the meantime, it's up to us to try to put the pieces together. <br>

For this assignment, we were tasked with assembling a filterable website containing a table of UFO sighting data. <br>

The objective was to build a table from a JavaScript data file, render it to a website, and make it searchable using D3 and Javascript. The first layer (contained in the file UFO-level-1) searches and filters only by date. The second layer (UFO-level-2) allows a user to filter on up to five criteria. Each website is responsive using Bootstrap CSS.
